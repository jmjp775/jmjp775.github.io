Here is where you can also look up for the latest ski conditions before going for a ski at your favourite local trail!

add the following icons:

- _groomed_ or _not-groomed_
- _glide-wax-colour_
- _grip-wax-colour_
- _ski-location_

> Add Markdown syntax content to file `_tabs/about.md`{: .filepath } and it will show up on this page.
